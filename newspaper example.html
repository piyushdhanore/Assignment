							September gathering of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Yet even in this rarefied sphere, many VIPs will be angling to catch up with one man. For a fleeting moment, dignitaries will be able to have a quiet word or a snap quick selfie with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky without having to take a 10-hour train ride through an active war zone.

							“This mullah is causing problems for you, and for me and for all of us. Do you want me to take care of the problem?” Saddam Hussein, military dictator of Iraq, asked Mohammad Reza Shah in August 1978. He was speaking about Ruhollah Khomeini, a senior cleric who had settled in Najaf and for months had been calling for regime change. The Shah declined Saddam’s offer to assassinate the Ayatollah.

							In July, nearly a dozen Chinese and Russian warships conducted 20 combat exercises in the Sea of Japan before beginning a 2,300-nautical-mile joint patrol, including into the waters near Alaska. These two operations, according to the Chinese defense ministry, “reflect the level of the strategic mutual trust” between the two countries and their militaries.

						The rift burst into the open on Monday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada was investigating "credible allegations" about the potential involvement of Indian government agents in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in June.
 						India responded furiously - it "completely rejected" the allegations, calling them "absurd". Both have expelled one of the other's diplomats and it's unclear how they now pull back from the brink. Just a few months ago, the countries were making progress towards signing a free trade agreement - long in the works - this year. Now, talks are paused and an imminent Canadian trade mission to India postponed.

							<a class="heading" href="https://psyche.co/ideas/this-is-how-your-brain-distinguishes-reality-from-imagination" target="blank"><b>This is how your brain distinguishes reality from imagination</b></a><br>In 1910, the psychologist Mary Cheves West Perky asked volunteers what you’d think would be an easy question for them to answer: is what you’re seeing real or imaginary? In her research, she told people to imagine objects, such as an apple, while looking at a wall. Then, secretly, she used an early projector called a magic lantern to cast the same image. The participants had trouble distinguishing what they perceived with their eyes from what they imagined in their heads. This seminal experiment, and many since, have suggested that seeing and imagining seeing involve similar processes in the brain.

Earlier this month, scientists put them to bed as the Sun began to set on the Moon - to be able to function, the lander-rover need sunlight to charge their batteries. The country's space research agency Isro said it hoped that they would reawaken "around 22 September" when the next lunar day breaks. Isro has provided regular updates on their movements and findings and shared images taken by them. These updates have excited many Indians, but others have been asking about the significance of these discoveries.
